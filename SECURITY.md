# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the OVS App seriously. If you discover any security vulnerabilities, we appreciate your help in disclosing them to us in a responsible manner.

Please **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead, please report it privately to us via:

-   **Email**: ahmaddimas1945@gmail.com

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

-   A detailed description of the vulnerability.
-   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
-   Any proof-of-concept code or exploits.
-   Information about the environment where you discovered the vulnerability (e.g., operating system, browser, version of OVS App).

We will acknowledge your email within 24-48 hours and will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix. We kindly request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a security vulnerability has been reported, we will take the following steps:

1.  **Confirmation and Triage**: We will confirm the receipt of your report and begin investigating the issue.
2.  **Remediation**: Our team will work to develop a fix for the vulnerability.
3.  **Notification**: Once the fix is ready and deployed, we will inform the reporter. We may also issue a public announcement or security advisory if the vulnerability is severe enough.
